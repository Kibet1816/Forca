    	<p> Since high school,coding has been my passion.Reading<strong> Mark Zuckerberg's biography</strong> inspired me to embark on this journey.I began self-tutelage and learning how to code online.When I heard of <em>Moringa School,</em>I looked it up on Google where I heard of student life experiences from the alumni which eventually made me take the next step and apply.I see this as a big opportunity to take a huge step in changing the face of tech not only in Kenya but also in Africa and inspire more youth to venture into coding.</p>
